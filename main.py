import RenameFilesGUI
#Runs the GUI loop through RenameFilesGUI. After running main.py, you select an input folder from which you take unnamed
#Mastery Check images, and an output folder to which the properly named files go.
#There are some responsibility issues in the organization of this code, which could be improved by separating
#the loop from running inside the GUI.
